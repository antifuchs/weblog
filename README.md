# My new blog

This is my new hugo blog. Mental note: Document how stuff works
because being unable to even operate this machinery when you want to
write a post is not going to make you want to write more posts.

## How to deploy

This blog is hosted on [netlify](https://app.netlify.com), and it's
set up to deploy the site whenever the master branch gets pushed.

## How to test out stuff

The `develop` branch deploys to the test blog setup in netlify,
definitely check that out too.

## Redirects

These live in `static/_redirects`; They
follow [netlify's scheme](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/).
