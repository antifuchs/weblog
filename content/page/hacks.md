Here's some stuff I've been working on ([github](http://github.com/antifuchs) has the most recent & up-to-date info):

## Current stuff

These are some of the things that I am currently working on:

Watch history unfold at [my github account](https://github.com/antifuchs) and this blog's category [Hacks](/categories/hacks/).

## Historical stuff

### Common Lisp

* Once upon a time, I did some administrative work for the [SBCL](/sbcl) project
  * Actual code: a [gdbinit for SBCL](http://static.boinkor.net/lisp/sbcl/gdbinit)
* I helped resurrect [iterate](http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/) from the CMU AI repository. Joerg Hoehle and Attila Lendvai are taking good care of it now.
* I wrote a [UBF encoder/decoder](http://common-lisp.net/project/ubf) for Common Lisp when I was bored. ([see](http://www.sics.se/~joe/ubf/site/home.html))
* I wrote [Autobench](/2006/01/sbcl-autobenching-a.k.a.-boinkmarking-howto/) to burn CPU cycles on this box.
* A [VT100 screen scraper](/screen-scraper) I wrote during my time at SILVER SERVER Gmbh was released as Open Source software.
