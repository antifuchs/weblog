## Some Trivia

## What is Andreas Fuchs doing right now?

To learn what I'm up to as it happens, read my [weblog](/). Here's a summary: I work for a [startup company](http://stripe.com) in the SF Bay Area. Before that, I was consulting on lispy problems (Want me to solve problems for you? send me [e-mail](mailto:asf@boinkor.net).) In my spare time, I enjoy hacking in Common Lisp, building robots, listening to music, listening to and reading and watching good stories being told.
