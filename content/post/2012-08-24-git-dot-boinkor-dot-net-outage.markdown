title: git.boinkor.net outage

I'm currently moving some of boinkor.net's services off the creaky old
machine that used to host it, over to another machine. This affects
git.boinkor.net - it's not going to be available for the next 2 days.
(With a bit of luck, it may be back up a little sooner, though.)

This probably affects you if you follow the slime and mcclim git repos
hosted there.

This was caused by a case of really bad planning on my part. Sorry for
the inconvenience.
