<p>Alright, I seem to have finished the <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/">atom</a> feed exporter. The whole
thing is less painful than I thought. Check out the shiny button:</p>

<p>clicking <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http://boinkor.net/journal.atom"><img src="/img/valid-atom.png" alt="valid atom!" title="" /></a> should tell you that this is a valid feed.</p>

<p>Haha. Of course, the atom button invalidates the feed because muse&#8217;s
html generator doesn&#8217;t insert &lt;/P&gt; tags everywhere it should -
and it doesn&#8217;t yet escape &gt; and &lt; correctly. But for now, this
will work well enough.</p>
