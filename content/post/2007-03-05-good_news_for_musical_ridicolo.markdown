It's a great tradition on the channel [#lisp](irc://freenode.net/lisp) to watch the [Eurovision Song contest](http://www.eurovision.tv/) live transmission, make fun of participants, and get drunk in the process. From [today's news](http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/2007/03/nice_try_sweden.html), it sounds like 2007 is going to be a good year for this kind of thing:

>Unfortunately, Europe took the wrong lessons from Lordi: they're now inserting monster references into their
>bovine love ballads. Sweden's entry to Eurovision 2007 is this monstrosity, 'Vampires Are Alive' by DJ Bobo.
>I swear I'm not making that up. The lyrics go: "I am a vampire. I’m a slave./I sleep through the daylight,
>hence my grave."

"Unfortunately"? "Monstrosity"? DJ Bobo?? Hah. Hahaha.

***Update***: Bruce O'Neel tells me that the DJ Bobo entry is not from Sweden, but from Switzerland. I was wondering about that. Also, note that the [link above](http://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/2007/03/nice_try_sweden.html) has an embedded YouTube video of the entry. I particularly enjoyed the "VAMPIRES!" chorus near the end.
