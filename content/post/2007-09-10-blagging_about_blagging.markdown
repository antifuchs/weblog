I just upgraded this blog to MovableType 4, for which this is a test entry. While I'm at it, I might as well say things about where I've been gone in the last couple of months. First, I spent a lovely week in Cambridge, MA, consulting for ITA software. (Photographic evidence [here](http://www.23hq.com/antifuchs/album/2315744).)

Now I'm hacking on a sweet new project again (news about that in due time, I promise). In the meantime, I started a new (lighter on the technical content, heavier on the pop cultural stuff) tumblelog at [http://mublag.boinkor.net/](http://mublag.boinkor.net/). This one's powered by [Soup](http://soup.io), a new blogging platform that two friends of mine are just launching.

Right. More technical content will happen in a few days. Until then, don't look at the Unicorn baby link.
