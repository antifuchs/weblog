As of today, there are two new Lisp tips blogs on the web: [Common Lisp tips](http://lisptips.tumblr.com) by [Xach](http://xach.livejournal.com/) and [SLIME tips](http://slime-tips.tumblr.com/) by Stas. Both already have some nice stuff that I didn't know about, so I hope they keep the tips coming!
