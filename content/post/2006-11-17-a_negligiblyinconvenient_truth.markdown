Xach knows me better than I know myself. This time, it's because I do
have another (not really top secret, but slightly embarassing, so not
linked here) blog. Have had one for 5 years, in fact. And its sole
purpose is to impress my future self with how hip and with-it my
younger self was.

Somehow, it never has had the effect on my then-present selves that my
then-past selves intended. Which, if I think about it, is a good
thing.
