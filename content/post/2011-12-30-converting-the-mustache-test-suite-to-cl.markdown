Matthew Snyder has a great
[introductory post](http://msnyder.info/posts/2011/12/common-lisp-mustache/)
on his blog where he converts the
[Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/)
[spec](https://github.com/mustache/spec) into a runnable
[fiveam](http://common-lisp.net/project/bese/FiveAM.html) test
suite. Very cool stuff - I hope he posts more (-:
