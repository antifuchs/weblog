<p>McCLIM 0.9.1 was <a href="http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/mcclim-devel/2005-March/003759.html">released</a> today. I have hopes that the next
(time-boxed) releases will work as well as this one.</p>

<p>That means it is time for you, dear reader/hacker, to write neat
McCLIM-using applications. Making one that does useful things is
<a href="http://boinkor.net/lisp/rt-clim.lisp">really</a> <a href="http://boinkor.net/lisp/clim-lastfm-0.0.tar.gz">easy</a>.</p>
