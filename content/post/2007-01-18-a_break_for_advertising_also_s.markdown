(No Lisp content here, move along, planet.lisp reader...)

For a few months now, I've been heckling Mac DVD [burning](http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?DiscRecording) [software](http://discoapp.com) [authors](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/6351) to provide full DVD+RW support (as in, the ability to append files to a burned DVD+RW, the way [growisofs](http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/) and its amazing front-end, [k3b](http://k3b.kde.org/) do on Linux). To no avail. I got all sorts of lame excuses, from lack of hardware support to no interest.

To spite those lazy burning application authors, I decided to do it myself. Using the freshly ported growisofs (lack of hardware support, hah), I wrote a <strike>horrible</strike>proof-of-concept application that was able to add files to the file system of a DVD+RW medium. When I discovered that the author of [BurnAgain](http://freeridecoding.net/burnagain/) (which did what I wanted, only for CDs) lives only a few streets away from me, I immediately pitched my idea to him. And he agreed! I gave him my proof of concept, and now he has delivered a complete product: Behold the shiny [BurnAgain DVD](http://freeridecoding.net/burnagain/)!

If you have a Mac, and are interested in DVD creation, you really should buy it (or give it a try, it comes with 20 trial burns). No other product (not the Finder, not Toast and certainly not Disco) can do what it does: Incrementally add files to a DVD medium.
