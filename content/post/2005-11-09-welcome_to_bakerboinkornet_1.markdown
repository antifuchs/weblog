I just moved this weblog over to baker.boinkor.net, my new and shiny machine in another co-location. It's a nice AMD64 machine (HP DL145 g1) with a nice amount of RAM, but the best part of it is that there's a management interface that allows me to power it up remotely. No more travelling to the colocation in order to powercycle it (which, I hope, won't happen anyway since it's new and shiny and it has actual warranty).

So. Woo yay.
