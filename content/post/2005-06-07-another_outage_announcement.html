<p>Walrus crashed again the day before yesterday with the same symptoms as <a href="http://www.boinkor.net/archives/2005/06/anger_managemen.html">the last few times</a>. What complicated matters is that I am on vacation about 60km away from the machine, without transport and with bad net connectivity (yeah, on purpose (-:). Finding somebody who could reboot it took quite a while, but a kind soul did just that, around 19:00 CEST yesterday. Sorry for the trouble this caused.</p>

<p>I hope walrus survives until Sunday. </p>

<p>New hardware status:</p>
