[McCLIM](http://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim) 0.9.2 was [released today](http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/mcclim-devel/2006-March/004524.html), just in (CEST) time to be called Laetare Sunday. (-:

Lots and lots of things are new and cool in this release. See the [release notes](http://common-lisp.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/mcclim/ReleaseNotes/0-9-2-laetare-sunday?rev=1.2&root=mcclim&view=auto) for details.

Kudos go to the whole McCLIM crowd for making this release happen!
