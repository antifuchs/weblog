I just saw that David Cooper's [Basic Lisp Techniques](http://www.franz.com/resources/educational_resources/cooper.book.pdf) is now available [on Amazon, as a Kindle edition](http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Lisp-Techniques-ebook/dp/B0058V1FJG/ref=sr_1_1), for $9.95.

Problem is, this book is freely available [on the Franz web site](http://www.franz.com/resources/educational_resources/cooper.book.pdf), doesn't seem like it is an authorized conversion, and judging from the free sample the Kindle edition it is a slightly crappy (footnotes didn't convert properly, ToC is ugly) pdf->azw conversion of the PDF. I recommend using the free PDF (you can even convert it yourself using [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) if you want the book on an e-reader, it's not hard at all to get very readable results).
